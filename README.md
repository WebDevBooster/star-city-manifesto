## Smarter city for smarter people.

Too many things are wrong in today's world. But instead of complaining, we want to build a smarter alternative. A new, independent city-state called Star City. 

Star City will be more sustainable, more fun and provide a higher living standard than any other mega-city on the planet. With your help, Star City will become a shining beacon for the world to follow. 

With the help of 100 million smart people like you, Star City will demonstrate how to solve the world's biggest problems. And by building the first space elevator Star City aims to become the undisputed world leader in science and technology.

With science and technology — and with smart people like you — we will turn this 100-million-strong city into the greenest, most sustainable and most fun mega-city on the planet. Join us if you want to make a real impact. Join us if you are smarter!
